# ðŸ¤– AverageMod Discord.js Bot
Welcome to the official repository for the Discord bot that runs the [AverageJonas](https://discord.gg/AverageJonas), community. This bot was developed by me, Kaisarion, while mentoring ReeceDead <br/>
<br/>
**DISCLAIMER:** This bot was made solely for AJ's Discord, so some commands are tweaked to that. Please be sure to read comments and change things if you will use it for your server.

In all honesty, this is pretty risky to set up on your own for many reasons. I highly recommend you do not clone this, but if you know what you're doing, nice.

## ðŸ–‡ Hosting
If you want to host this bot without having to re-run it locally on your computer and restarting it every time you shut it down, I suggest the following:

<br/>

**VPS:** <br/>
[Heroku, for private bots:](https://heroku.com)<br/>This has free hosting, and runs for the entire month if you link a valid debit/credit card too! This is how I host my public bot, [Amour](https://amourbot.com) (On a professional dyno.) <br/>
<br/>
[DigitalOcean, a VPS company:](https://m.do.co/c/aecdbe57ea38)<br/>This is also a good solution, with a range of operating systems such as Ubuntu, which is a personal favorite (: <br/>
<br/>
[Glitch:](https://glitch.com/)<br/>This is a simple yet effective host, especially for plain bots like this. Put your token in and you're off. Just make sure your project is private, or people can steal your tokens! <br/>
<br/>
[Repl.it:](https://repl.it/)<br/>This site can grab your GitHub repository with ease if you clone this one and edit it to your liking, and it has been efficient for me in the past when working on small bots for friends.
<br/>

## ðŸ“ž Support
If you need help setting up the bot or are having trouble, feel free to reach out to me at hi@bea.gg, my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmourKrim), or my Discord, REDRUM#0001.

Good luck!
